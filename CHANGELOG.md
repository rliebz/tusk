# Changelog
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased
### Added
- Add `values` field for options. Any option directly passed by command line
  flag or environment variable must be one of the listed values, if specified.

### Fixed
- Fix various issues with Zsh tab completions.

## 0.2.1 (2017-11-12)
### Added
- Environment variables can now be set and unset inside of a `run` clause. This
  replaces the `export` functionality that was previously under `option`.
- Tasks can now be defined as private.

### Changed
- Change to more minimalistic UI output theme.
- Log-level messages (Debug, Info, Warning, and Error) are now printed in title
  case instead of all caps.

### Deprecated
- Environment variables should no longer be set inside of an `option` clause.


## 0.2.0 (2017-11-08)
### Added
- Windows is now supported.
- New -s/--silent global option available for no stderr/stdout.

### Changed
- Shell commands are now executed by the `SHELL` environment variable by
  default. If `SHELL` is not set, `sh` is used.

### Fixed
- Avoid infinite loop when searching for tusk.yml in non-unix file systems.

### Fixed
- Bash and Zsh completions offer file completion for subcommand flags that take
  a value rather than re-offering flag names.

### Changed
- Bash and Zsh completions now complete global flags and task flags.
- Zsh completion now includes usage information.

  installed with Homebrew.
